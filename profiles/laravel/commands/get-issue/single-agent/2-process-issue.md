## Bug Workflow

<bug_instructions>

### Bug Processing Steps

**Step 2.1: Check for Sufficient Information**

Review the issue body for:
- [ ] Steps to reproduce the bug
- [ ] Expected behavior description
- [ ] Actual behavior description
- [ ] Environment details (Laravel version, PHP version, etc. - if relevant)

IF any critical information is missing:
  1. Determine what specific information is needed
  2. Create a helpful comment requesting it:
     ```bash
     gh issue comment {issue_number} --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
     Hi @{issue_author}, thank you for reporting this issue.

     To help us diagnose and fix this bug, could you please provide:

     - [Specific information needed]
     - [Additional context needed]
     - [Steps to reproduce if missing]

     This information will help us reproduce and resolve the issue more quickly.
     EOF
     )"
     ```
  3. STOP workflow - no further action until more information provided
  4. Report to user: "I've requested more information from the issue author. We'll need to wait for their response before proceeding."

IF sufficient information exists: Continue to Step 2.2

**Step 2.2: Assess Bug Complexity**

Analyze the bug to determine complexity:

**SIMPLE BUG Indicators:**
- Single component or file affected
- Clear reproduction steps
- Obvious cause or solution
- Can be tested with a single regression test
- Likely 1-3 file changes needed

**COMPLEX BUG Indicators:**
- Multiple components involved
- Unclear root cause
- Requires deep investigation
- Needs multiple regression tests
- Likely 5+ files need changes
- Architectural implications

Make determination: Is this a SIMPLE or COMPLEX bug?

IF SIMPLE: Continue to Step 2.3
IF COMPLEX: Skip to Step 2.4

**Step 2.3: Fix Simple Bug**

Execute the following workflow:

1. **Create Branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git checkout -b {issue_number}-{kebab-case-of-issue-title}
   ```

2. **Write Regression Test:**
   - Create a test that demonstrates the bug
   - Run the test to verify it FAILS (proving the bug exists)
   - Test file should be in appropriate location (tests/Feature/ or tests/Unit/)
   - Run: `composer test -- --filter={TestClassName}`

3. **Fix the Bug:**
   - Make minimal changes to fix the issue
   - Follow code style standards in @.agent-os/standards/
   - Keep changes focused and small

4. **Verify Fix:**
   - Run regression test: `composer test -- --filter={TestClassName}`
   - Verify test now PASSES
   - Run full suite: `composer ready`

5. **Evaluate Result:**

   IF all tests pass:
     - Continue to Step 2.5 (Create PR)

   IF fix unsuccessful or `composer ready` reveals bigger issues:
     - Reclassify as COMPLEX bug
     - Continue to Step 2.4

**Step 2.4: Handle Complex Bug**

For complex bugs, delegate to spec creation workflow:

1. Tell user: "This bug is complex and requires detailed planning. I'll create a spec to document the fix requirements."

2. Invoke spec creation:
   ```
   I need to create a spec for this bug fix. Here's the context:

   **Bug Issue:** #{issue_number}
   **Title:** {issue_title}
   **Description:** {issue_body}

   This is a complex bug that requires:
   - Multiple file changes
   - Comprehensive test coverage
   - Careful investigation of root cause

   Please follow @.agent-os/instructions/create-spec.md to create a specification for fixing this bug.
   ```

3. STOP workflow - delegate to create-spec command
4. The spec will capture full requirements for the bug fix

**Step 2.5: Create Pull Request (Simple Bugs Only)**

After successful fix:

1. **Commit Changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix: {brief description of fix}

   Resolves #{issue_number}

   - Added regression test demonstrating bug
   - Fixed issue in {file names}
   - All tests passing

   ü§ñ Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)

   Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"
   ```

2. **Push Branch:**
   ```bash
   git push origin {issue_number}-{kebab-case-title}
   ```

3. **Create Pull Request:**
   ```bash
   gh pr create --title "Fix: {issue_title}" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
   ## Summary

   Fixes #{issue_number}

   ## Changes Made

   - Added regression test demonstrating the bug
   - Fixed issue by [brief explanation]
   - Verified all tests pass

   ## Testing

   - Regression test: [test file path]
   - All tests passing via `composer ready`

   ## Related Issue

   Closes #{issue_number}
   EOF
   )" --base main
   ```

4. **Link PR to Issue:**
   The "Closes #{issue_number}" in the PR body will auto-link and close the issue when merged.

5. Report to user:
   ```
   ‚úÖ Bug Fixed and PR Created

   - Branch: {branch_name}
   - Regression test: [test file]
   - All tests passing
   - PR: [PR URL from gh output]
   - Issue will auto-close when PR is merged
   ```

## Feature Request Workflow

<feature_instructions>

### Feature Request Processing Steps

**Step 2.1: Check for Sufficient Context**

Review the issue body for:
- [ ] Clear description of desired functionality
- [ ] Use cases or user stories
- [ ] Acceptance criteria (if provided)
- [ ] Any technical considerations

IF critical context is missing:
  1. Determine what information is needed to create a good spec
  2. Create a comment requesting it:
     ```bash
     gh issue comment {issue_number} --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
     Hi @{issue_author}, thank you for this feature request.

     To help us create a detailed specification, could you please provide:

     - [Specific use case details needed]
     - [User story clarifications needed]
     - [Technical requirements if known]

     This will help us plan and implement this feature effectively.
     EOF
     )"
     ```
  3. STOP workflow
  4. Report to user: "I've requested more details from the issue author before creating a spec."

IF sufficient context exists: Continue to Step 2.2

**Step 2.2: Create Feature Spec**

Delegate to spec creation workflow:

1. Tell user: "I have enough context to create a spec for this feature request."

2. Invoke spec creation:
   ```
   I need to create a spec for this feature request. Here's the context:

   **Feature Request:** #{issue_number}
   **Title:** {issue_title}
   **Description:** {issue_body}

   Please follow @.agent-os/instructions/create-spec.md to create a specification for implementing this feature.
   ```

3. The spec creation workflow will:
   - Create spec folder with date and name
   - Create spec.md with requirements
   - Create technical specifications
   - Create task breakdown
   - Link back to issue #{issue_number}

4. After spec is created, add comment to issue:
   ```bash
   gh issue comment {issue_number} --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
   Spec created for this feature request: [spec path]

   The spec documents requirements and implementation plan. Work will proceed according to the Agent OS workflow.
   EOF
   )"
   ```

5. Report to user:
   ```
   ‚úÖ Feature Spec Created

   - Spec: [spec folder path]
   - Linked to issue #{issue_number}
   - Ready for implementation via execute-tasks workflow
   ```

     - Review failures
     - IF easily fixable: fix and retry
     - IF complex issues: report to user
       ```
       ‚ö†Ô∏è Patch Issues Detected

       The patch from issue #{issue_number} causes the following problems:
       [list failures from composer ready]

## Question Workflow

<question_instructions>

### Question Response Steps

**Step 2.1: Analyze Question**

1. Read question carefully
2. Determine what user is asking
3. Check if question reveals an actual bug or feature request

**Step 2.2: Research Answer**

Search for answer in:
- Project documentation (README, docs folder)
- Code comments and docblocks
- Related code examples in codebase
- Common patterns in the project

**Step 2.3: Provide Response**

1. **If question is answerable:**
   ```bash
   gh issue comment {issue_number} --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
   Hi @{issue_author},

   [Clear explanation of the answer]

   [Code examples if relevant - with proper formatting]

   [Links to documentation if available]

   [Suggestions for further help if needed]

   I hope this helps! If this answers your question, feel free to close this issue.

   ```

2. **If question reveals a bug:**
   - Reclassify as BUG
   - Tell user: "This question actually reveals a bug. Reclassifying and processing as a bug."
   - Return to Bug Workflow

3. **If question reveals a feature need:**
   - Reclassify as FEATURE REQUEST
   - Tell user: "This question suggests we need a new feature. Reclassifying as a feature request."
   - Return to Feature Request Workflow

4. **If unable to answer:**
   ```bash
   gh issue comment {issue_number} --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
   Hi @{issue_author},

   This requires input from the project maintainer or someone with deeper context. I've tagged this for human review.

   [Explain what additional context is needed]
   EOF
