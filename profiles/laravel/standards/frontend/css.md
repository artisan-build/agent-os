## CSS best practices

- **Consistent Methodology**: Do not write any inline CSS. Rely solely on Tailwind classes and utilities.
- **Avoid Overriding Framework Styles**: FluxUI's defaults are almost always correct. Use Flux variants sparingly when appropriate.
- **Maintain Design System**: Do not devaiate from the design system. Never create your own colors or use a different font. Rely on FluxUI's defaults.
