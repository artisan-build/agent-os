# Git Workflow Implementation - Summary of Changes

## Overview

Implemented a deliberate, review-focused git branching and PR workflow for the Laravel profile that creates clear review points at both the specification and task levels.

## Changes Made

### 1. Multi-Agent Commands Updated

#### `/create-spec` Command
**File**: `profiles/laravel/commands/create-spec/multi-agent/create-spec.md`

**Added Phase 4: Create Spec Branch and Draft PR**
- Extracts spec name from folder (removes date prefix)
- Creates spec branch from current branch
- Commits all spec files (spec.md, tasks.md, verification)
- Pushes spec branch to origin
- Creates **draft PR** targeting `main` with:
  - Spec overview
  - List of all tasks to be implemented
  - Status checklist
- Displays results and next steps to user

**Modified Phase 5: Display Results**
- Now includes spec branch name and draft PR URL
- Explains that each task will have its own PR targeting spec branch

#### `/implement-spec` Command
**File**: `profiles/laravel/commands/implement-spec/multi-agent/implement-spec.md`

**Complete Rewrite** to implement sequential task workflow:

**PHASE 1**: Verify Spec Branch and Identify Next Task
- Ensures on correct branch (spec branch)
- Pulls latest from spec branch
- Identifies next uncompleted task from tasks.md
- Confirms with user before proceeding

**PHASE 2**: Create Task Branch and Implement
- Creates task branch from spec branch: `[number]-[task-name-slug]`
- Delegates to appropriate implementer subagent
- Implements task following TDD
- Ensures all tests pass
- Updates tasks.md

**PHASE 3**: Create Task PR Targeting Spec Branch
- Commits all changes
- Pushes task branch
- Creates **regular PR** (not draft) targeting **spec branch** (not main)
- Switches back to spec branch

**PHASE 4**: Wait for User Review
- Displays summary with PR URL
- **STOPS** - does not proceed until user explicitly continues
- User reviews PR, merges into spec branch
- User instructs agent to continue with next task

**When All Tasks Complete**:
- Prompts user about final verification
- Offers to mark spec PR as ready for review
- User eventually merges spec PR into main

### 2. Single-Agent Commands Updated

#### `create-spec` Step 3
**File**: `profiles/laravel/commands/create-spec/single-agent/3-verify-spec.md`

**Added: Create Spec Branch and Draft PR section** (same as multi-agent)
- Creates spec branch
- Commits spec files
- Pushes and creates draft PR
- Updates display message with branch and PR info

#### `implement-spec` - New File
**File**: `profiles/laravel/commands/implement-spec/single-agent/implement-task.md`

**Created new command** for single-task implementation:
- Implements ONE task at a time
- Same git workflow as multi-agent version
- Step-by-step process for:
  - Verifying spec branch
  - Creating task branch
  - Implementing task
  - Creating PR targeting spec branch
  - Waiting for user review
- References workflow templates via `{{workflows/...}}` syntax
- Includes user standards compliance

### 3. Documentation Created

#### Git Workflow Guide
**File**: `profiles/laravel/GIT-WORKFLOW.md`

**Comprehensive workflow documentation** including:
- Overview of branch structure
- Phase 1: Spec Creation process
- Phase 2: Sequential task implementation
- Phase 3: Spec completion
- Branch naming conventions
- Pull request strategy
- Example workflows
- Command summary table
- Important notes and reminders

## Workflow Summary

```
main branch
 │
 └─ spec-branch (draft PR → main)
     │
     ├─ 1-task-name (PR → spec-branch) [merge]
     │
     ├─ 2-task-name (PR → spec-branch) [merge]
     │
     ├─ 3-task-name (PR → spec-branch) [merge]
     │
     └─ ... all tasks merged
         │
         └─ mark spec PR ready → review → merge to main
```

## Key Principles

1. **Spec Branch**: Every spec gets its own branch (without date prefix)

2. **Draft PR First**: Spec PR is created as draft for review before implementation

3. **Sequential Tasks**: One task at a time, no parallel work

4. **Task Branches**: Each task gets its own branch from spec branch

5. **Task PRs**: Regular PRs (not drafts) targeting spec branch (not main)

6. **User-Controlled Merges**: Agent creates PRs, user reviews and merges

7. **Isolated Reviews**: Each PR shows only one task's changes

8. **Incremental Progress**: Can stop at any point, merged tasks are done

## Branch Naming

- **Spec Branch**: `[spec-name]` (e.g., `password-reset`)
- **Task Branch**: `[number]-[task-name-slug]` (e.g., `1-database-schema`)

## PR Strategy

### Spec PR
- **Type**: Draft initially
- **Targets**: main
- **Created**: After spec.md and tasks.md are done
- **Contains**: All spec documentation
- **Marked Ready**: After all tasks merged

### Task PRs
- **Type**: Regular PR (not draft)
- **Targets**: Spec branch (NOT main)
- **Created**: After each task implementation
- **Contains**: Changes for one specific task only
- **Merged By**: User after review

## Benefits

1. **Clear Review Points**: Spec review before implementation, task review after each task
2. **Isolation**: Each PR contains only related changes
3. **Flexibility**: Can pause/resume at any task boundary
4. **History**: Clear git history showing spec → task progression
5. **Debugging**: Easy to identify when issues were introduced
6. **Collaboration**: Multiple people can review different aspects

## GitHub CLI Usage

All GitHub operations use `gh` command:
- `gh pr create --draft`: Create draft PR
- `gh pr create --base [branch]`: Create PR targeting specific branch
- `gh pr ready [number]`: Mark draft PR as ready
- `gh pr list`: List PRs

## Files Modified

### Created
- `profiles/laravel/GIT-WORKFLOW.md` (documentation)
- `profiles/laravel/commands/implement-spec/single-agent/implement-task.md` (new command)
- `agent-os/GIT-WORKFLOW-CHANGES.md` (this file)

### Modified
- `profiles/laravel/commands/create-spec/multi-agent/create-spec.md`
- `profiles/laravel/commands/create-spec/single-agent/3-verify-spec.md`
- `profiles/laravel/commands/implement-spec/multi-agent/implement-spec.md`

## Scope

These changes apply **ONLY to the Laravel profile**. The default profile remains unchanged.

## Next Steps for Users

When using the Laravel profile:

1. Run `/new-spec` to initialize and gather requirements
2. Run `/create-spec` to create spec documents → **creates draft PR automatically**
3. Review draft PR, request iterations if needed
4. Run `/implement-spec` to implement first task → **creates task PR automatically**
5. Review task PR, merge into spec branch
6. Repeat step 4-5 for each task
7. Mark spec PR ready, final review, merge to main

This workflow ensures every change is reviewed at the appropriate level before becoming part of the main codebase.
